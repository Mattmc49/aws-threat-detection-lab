# üîê AWS Threat Detection Lab

Welcome to the AWS Threat Detection Lab a hands-on project showcasing how to detect, alert, and respond to security threats in AWS using native services and minimal custom code. This lab simulates real-world attack scenarios and provides infrastructure and logic to detect them in real-time.

---

## üß≠ Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- Simulate AWS threat activity like privilege escalation and suspicious logins
- Detect malicious activity using **AWS GuardDuty**, **CloudTrail**, and **Security Hub**
- Route findings to **EventBridge**, trigger **Lambda alerts**, and notify via **SNS**
- Deploy everything with **Terraform** for reproducibility
